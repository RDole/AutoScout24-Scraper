# AutoScout24 Scraper

This Scraper can technically scrape all the cars advertised on www.autoscout24.com. As an example, we collected links to all
Austrian cars being advertised for less than EUR 100k and scraped a representative sample of 182 vehicles.
The scraper also includes code to easily adjust the criteria of cars to be scraped, as well as the possibility to store the data on a local SQL database.

All of the scraped data is currently already available to anyone with an internet connection and normal webbrowser, and does as such does not violate anyone's intellectual property.

Feel free to use our code, however, we do not accept any liability with regards to the code itself or its usage by others.
